== Ansible Installer

The following are the steps to install using the Ansible based installer.

When using the Ansible installer, the installation process is carried out on any machine where Ansible is installed.
We will refer to this machine as "the Ansible node".

You can use any one of the master or the worker node as an Ansible node.

This install procedure should be done in the `ansible` directory of `k8s-installer`.

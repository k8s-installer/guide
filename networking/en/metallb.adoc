=== MetalLB

You can use MetalLB as an implementation of the LoadBalancer.

See https://metallb.universe.tf/[MetalLB] for details.
There are two operating modes for MetalLB, L2 mode and BGP mode, but this installer supports only L2 mode.

If you want to use MetalLB, you need to change the file `inventory/group_vars/all/networking.yml` file with editor and add configurations.
An example configuration is shown below.

```yaml
# Enable MetalLB?
metallb_enabled: yes

# MetalLB IP address pool range
metallb_ip_range: 192.168.1.200-192.168.1.210
```

* metallb_enabled: set to `yes`
* metallb_ip_range: IP address pool range to be used for LoadBalancer.
You must specify the free IP addresses on the subnet to which each node is connected.
